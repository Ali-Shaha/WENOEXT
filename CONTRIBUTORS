====== WENOEXT library ======

The weighted essentially non-oscillatory library was initially developed by
Tobias Martin at the University of Rostock. The method and its validation has 
been demonstrated in

@misc {tobiasMartinThesis,
    Author = {Tobias Martin},
    Title = {Development of a two-phase incompressible Navier-Stokes solver using a level set method},
    Howpublished = {Masterâ€™s thesis, Chair of Modelling and Simulation, University of Rostock},
    Year = {2016}
}

Please make a proper reference to this thesis, if the library is used.
