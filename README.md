# WENO framework

Weighted essentially non-oscillatory library for the framework of OpenFOAM.
Detailed information about the theoretical background and the implementation can 
be found in:

 * [Development of a Finite Volume Solver for Two-phase Incompressible Flows using a Level Set Method](Martin_Development_of_a_Finite_Volume_Solver_for_Two-phase_Incompressible_Flows_using_a_Level_Set_Method.pdf)
 * [Solving the Level Set Equation using High-order Non-oscillatory Reconstruction](Martin_Solving_the_Level_Set_Equation_using_High-order_Non-oscillatory_Reconstruction.pdf)
 * [Presentation: WENOExt](./WENOExt-Presentation.pdf)

**Versions:**

Different versions of the code are structured through tags:

 * [1.0] Version for OpenFOAM 5.x or higher
             Uses improved parallising and C++11 features 
 * [0.1] Version for OpenFOAM 2.3.x to OpenFOAM 5.x

## Installation

1. Clone the directory with
    `git clone https://github.com/TobiasMartin/WENOEXT.git`

2. Execute `Allwmake` to build the library


### Note to GNU compiler:

GNU compiler version must be higher than 7. For g++ < v7 an error is reported for 
the specialisation template syntax. 
The syntax in the code is according to C++11 standard which is available for g++ v7 and higher. 
 

## Usage

To use the WENO scheme you have to add the library to your controlDict by editing `system/controlDict`

    libs("libWENOEXT.so")

Within your `system/fvSchemes` file,

    divSchemes
    {
    	div(phi,U) 	Gauss WENOUpwindFit 2 1;
    }

Here the first index '2' represents the order of the WENO scheme and the second index can be either
'1' for bounded or '0' for unbounded.



## Tutorials

The code contains two tutorials from the standard cavity test. 
To run the tutorials execute `./Allrun` in the tutorial/ directory.

## Tests

For some general functions of the solver a unit test file is created, however testing is still incomplete.

## Execute Tests

Testing is performed with the CATCH2 framework. You can compile and execute the tests
by executing `./runTest` in the test directory. Further instructions are found in [here](tests/TestInstructions.md)
